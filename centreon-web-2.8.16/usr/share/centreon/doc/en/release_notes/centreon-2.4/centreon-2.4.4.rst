to do so go to `Administration` > `Options` > `CentStorage` > `Manage`, then
click on the metric you would like to update. In the "More actions" toolbar, you 
will now see the new data source types.

A new option is available, allowing you to choose the display order of the 
monitored resources. The new option is available in `Administration` > `Options`, 
in the `Problem display properties` section.
